# NeuroEvolutionVehicles

This Repository contains a Demo of Vehicles learning to drive on any given track being trained with a genetic algorithm. The Vehicles use a Neural Network which can be mutated randomly. The genetic algorithm then determines the best vehicle and generates a new population for the next generation. In most cases the vehicles have developed a basic understanding of the track in less than 10 generations.

## Plugin System
This Demo is written in a way that it can be easily expanded by plugins. Currently only plugins for tracks are supported. An example plugin can be seen [here](https://github.com/thebrainsgd/neuroevolutionvehiclespluginsample).  
The plugin-APIs can be found [here](https://thebrainsgd.github.io/NeuroEvolutionVehicles/).

## Installation
In order to run the application just clone the repository and execute the `mvn clean package` command. After this, you will find the executable jar file in the target folder of the NeuroEvolutionDemo directory.  
By the first start, the application will create a plugins folder next to the jar itself. In this folder you can place any number of track-plugins. By the next startup, the application will scan through this folder and loads any compatible plugin. 

## Logging 
The applications default logging level ist info. To get the debug logging level, run the application with `-Dlogging.level=DEBUG` as vm argument.
